# Code Replicator

**Code Replicator** is a Python-based automation tool built specially for students who are tired of editing the same assignments again and again for multiple classmates.

This tool allows you to generate personalized assignment files (Python/PDF) with custom names and roll numbers — either one by one or in bulk using a CSV file.

## Why I Built This

As a college student, I was constantly asked by friends to edit the same assignment file — just changing the name and roll number. It became frustrating, especially during submission deadlines.

So I built this tool to automate it and save hours of manual editing.
